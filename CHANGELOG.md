# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.4] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging for configuration hash comparison and power outlet settings
- **Configuration Validation Logging**: Shows current `usePowerOutlets` value and hash comparisons for troubleshooting

### Changed
- **Improved Debug Information**: Better visibility into why cache validation succeeds or fails
- **Configuration State Logging**: Logs current power outlet configuration for verification

### Technical
- **Debug Output**: Added logging for hash comparison and configuration state
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Better diagnostics for cache validation issues

## [1.2.3] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed
- **Cache Validation Timing**: Moved configuration hash validation to `configureAccessory` method for proper execution order
- **Immediate Cache Clearing**: Cache is now cleared immediately when configuration changes are detected, before accessories are loaded
- **Service Type Detection**: Ensures Outlet vs LightSensor services are properly applied on first load

### Changed
- **Improved Cache Management**: Cache validation now runs at the correct time in the Homebridge lifecycle
- **Better Error Handling**: Prevents duplicate accessory loading when configuration changes

### Technical
- **Lifecycle Optimization**: Cache validation moved from constructor to `configureAccessory` for proper timing
- **Immediate Response**: Configuration changes are detected and handled immediately, not deferred

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- **Intelligent Cache Management**: Automatic cache clearing when configuration changes
- **Configuration Hash Validation**: Detects changes in MQTT settings, device selection, or power outlet preferences
- **Automatic Service Type Updates**: Ensures new service types (Outlet vs LightSensor) are properly applied without manual cache clearing

### Changed
- **Improved Power Outlet Detection**: Better handling of configuration changes for `usePowerOutlets` setting
- **Enhanced Logging**: More informative messages about cache clearing and configuration changes

### Fixed
- **Cache Persistence Issues**: Resolves problems where changing `usePowerOutlets` from false to true didn't update existing accessories
- **Service Type Mismatches**: Prevents old LightSensor accessories from persisting when Outlet service is requested

### Technical
- **Configuration Hash Generation**: Simple but effective hash function for detecting configuration changes
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: Clears accessories, discovered devices, and device data when configuration changes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of cached data to prevent memory leaks
